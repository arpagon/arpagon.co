# Kilo

Kilo is a multi-cloud network overlay built on WireGuard and designed for Kubernetes.

## Overview

Kilo connects nodes in a cluster by providing an encrypted layer 3 network that can span across data centers and public clouds.
The Pod network created by Kilo is always fully connected, even when the nodes are in different networks or behind NAT.
By allowing pools of nodes in different locations to communicate securely, Kilo enables the operation of multi-cloud clusters.
Kilo's design allows clients to VPN to a cluster in order to securely access services running on the cluster.
In addition to creating multi-cloud clusters, Kilo enables the creation of multi-cluster services, i.e. services that span across different Kubernetes clusters.

An introductory video about Kilo from KubeCon EU 2019 can be found on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPz_DAOOCKA).

## How It Works

Kilo uses [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/), a performant and secure VPN, to create a mesh between the different nodes in a cluster.
The Kilo agent, `kg`, runs on every node in the cluster, setting up the public and private keys for the VPN as well as the necessary rules to route packets between locations.

Kilo can operate both as a complete, independent networking provider as well as an add-on complimenting the cluster-networking solution currently installed on a cluster.
This means that if a cluster uses, for example, Flannel for networking, Kilo can be installed on top to enable pools of nodes in different locations to join; Kilo will take care of the network between locations, while Flannel will take care of the network within locations.

# Cilium

eBPF-based Networking, Security, and Observability

## Overview

Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. It provides a simple flat Layer 3 network with the ability to span 
multiple clusters in either a native routing or overlay mode. It is L7-protocol aware and can enforce network policies on L3-L7 using an identity based security 
model that is decoupled from network addressing.

Cilium implements distributed load balancing for traffic between pods and to external services, and is able to fully replace kube-proxy, using efficient 
hash tables in eBPF allowing for almost unlimited scale. It also supports advanced functionality like integrated ingress and egress gateway, bandwidth 
management and service mesh, and provides deep network and security visibility and monitoring.

A new Linux kernel technology called eBPF_ is at the foundation of Cilium. It supports dynamic insertion of eBPF bytecode into the Linux kernel at various
integration points such as: network IO, application sockets, and tracepoints to implement security, networking and visibility logic. eBPF is highly efficient
and flexible. To learn more about eBPF, visit `eBPF.io`_.
